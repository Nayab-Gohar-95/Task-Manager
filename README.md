# Fullstack Task Manager (MERN)

## Overview
The **Task Manager System** is a web application designed to facilitate seamless task management for teams. Built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), this platform enables users to assign, track, and collaborate on tasks efficiently. The application supports **administrators** and **regular users**, offering a structured workflow to boost productivity and organization.

## Importance

The **Task Manager System** addresses these issues by providing a centralized and automated platform for task management, fostering better collaboration and workflow efficiency.

## Background
With an increasing number of distributed teams and remote work setups, tools for task coordination and communication have become a necessity. The **Task Manager System** leverages modern web technologies to create an interactive and user-friendly experience. The MERN stack ensures robust performance, and the integration of **Redux Toolkit, Headless UI, and Tailwind CSS** enhances usability and responsiveness.
